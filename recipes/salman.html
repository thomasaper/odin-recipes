            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Moist and tender salmon with a slightly sweet and salty crust—it's the perfect bite! This recipe is easy and a nice choice to serve for guests who aren't used to eating 
               salmon. Garnish with lemon slices and fresh parsley and serve alongside rice pilaf or roasted sweet potatoes.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with

                <li>Lay salmon, skin-side down, on the prepared baking sheet. Spread butter mixture
                    evenly over the salmon. Sprinkle with Greek seasoning and drizzle with ½ of the lemon juice.                </li>
                <li>Roast in the preheated oven until salmon flakes easily with a fork, 17 to 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle with remaining lemon juice and serve.</li>
